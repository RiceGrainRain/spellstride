Gen Idea:

Isometric, tile-based map.
4 player battle royale. Each player starts off in a separate corner of the map. 




Players choose from 4 separate classes that can be diversified further:

Warrior(med armor, med phys dmg, low mg dmg, low range)
Berserker(med armor, high phys dmg, low mg dmg, low range) Rage based mechanics - high dmg in trade for low def.
Paladin(med armor, med phys dmg, high mg dmg, low range) high magic dmg, array of self buffs.
Ranger(low armor, med phys dmg, low mg dmg, high range) chip and hit attacks. 
Warlord(high armor, med phys damage, low mg dmg, med range) variety of attacks, debuffs, and other random bs(smoke bombs what not) 
Wizard(low armor, low phys dmg, med mg dmg, medrange)
Sorcerer(low armor, low phys dmg, high mg dmg, high range) glass cannon
Necromancer(low armor, low phys dmg, med mg dmg, med range) summoning mage.
Oaf(low armor, med phys, low mg, low range) - EVOLUTION
Lizard -> dragon (med armor, low phys dmg, high mg damage, high range)
Golem - (high armor, low phys dmg, low mg dmg, low range)
Deceased(have to self kill) - (low armor, high phys dmg, high mg dmg, low range)

Card Types and Functionality
Each class (Wizard, Creature, Warrior, Monk) starts with a base set of abilities and can build a deck to diversify into different playstyles. Cards could fall into several categories:
Attack Cards: These define physical and magical attacks, damage output, and range. Example: "Fireball" (for Wizard classes), "Claw Swipe" (for oaf).
Defense Cards: Boosts defenses or resists damage temporarily. Example: "Shield Wall" (Warrior), "Stone Skin" (Monk).
Movement Cards: Allows players to move across the map with special abilities like dashes, teleports, or flight.
Utility/Support Cards: Buffs, debuffs, healing, traps, or environmental effects that add tactical layers. Example: "Healing Aura" (Monk), "Summon Skeleton" (Necromancer).
Class-Specific Cards: Each class gets cards tied to their identity. However, you can also make certain cards class-agnostic to increase build variety.
Class Diversification
As characters start in base classes, the cards they draw or acquire in-game could allow them to develop different playstyles:
Branching Archetypes: Base classes can branch into different archetypes based on deck-building choices. For instance:
Wizard → Might diversify into Sorcerer (glass cannon, high magic damage) or Necromancer (summoning and control).
Warrior → Could become a Tank (high defense, slower) or Berserker (high damage, lower defense)..
The card selection process determines these paths, allowing players to evolve their character’s identity.
Deck-Building Mechanics
implement a system where players have a set number of slots in their deck, and they fill these slots with different cards they acquire:
Pre-Game Deck Building: Players pick a base class and start with a set of common cards. As they level up or perform actions, they unlock more advanced cards to refine their playstyle.
In-Game Card Drafting: Players could draft new cards mid-game based on progress, creating more dynamic gameplay. This can tie into looting or exploration mechanics.
Custom Decks for Replayability: Encourage players to experiment with card synergies (for example, certain movement cards paired with ranged abilities for kiting).
Energy System: Ability Points
Since players rely on ability points (AP) to move and attack, each card could have a cost tied to it. Low-cost cards could be weaker but allow more frequent use, while high-cost cards are stronger but limit actions per turn.
Specialization Cards
include specific cards that push players toward specialization. For example, a Necromancer might find cards that summon undead or drain health, while a Sorcerer might have powerful AoE spells but less survivability.
